# Election_Analysis_and_Prediction

 Analysing and Predicting Election Outcomes in Kolar 
 
Given historical election data, key issues in the locality, and demographic data of the voters in Kolar, the task is to build predictive models that can estimate the probability of victory for each political party, namely BJP, JDS, and Congress, in the upcoming election. The goal is to leverage the available data to develop accurate and reliable models that can predict the likelihood of each party winning.
Ultimately, the objective is to provide a robust framework for estimating the probability of each political party's victory in the upcoming election, thereby assisting political parties, candidates, and policy makers in their decision-making processes and campaign planning.

Key Challenges:

	Feature Selection: Choosing relevant features that significantly influence electoral outcomes.
	Model Selection: Identifying the most suitable machine learning algorithms for this task.
	Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, transforming, and preparing the dataset for modeling. 

HYPOTHESIS

Based on the literature review, we propose the following hypotheses:
	Female voters prefer the congress party due to its focus on women-centric schemes like shakti and Gruha Lakshmi.
	Voters choose the congress party due to the guaranteed benefits provided by the congress government.
	Congress party attract Muslim voters due to concerns related to the hijab and the concept of a Hindu Rashtra
	Hindu voters tend to vote for the BJP due to its stance on the construction of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya.
	The failure of the Modi government in controlling essential commodity(LPG gas, milk, mustard oil, petrol, diesel) will effect the voting behaviour of low-income and middle-class households.
	Unemployment is a critical concern for the youth population and influence their voting decisions.
	poor and middle-class families like Gruha Jyoti and Gruha Lakshmi scheme and influence their voting decisions
	The Karnataka BJP’s decision to rejig the EWS(economically weaker section) quota and allocate part of it to Vokkaligas and Lingayats may impact voting preferences.
	Youth voters are inclined to support the BJP due to its positions on foreign policy decisions and international relations.
